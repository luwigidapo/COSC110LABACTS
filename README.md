**ACT1: Computational Thinking with the Titanic Dataset using Python**
I applied the four pillars of computational thinking to analyze the Titanic dataset. First, I decomposed the problem into data cleaning, exploration, and modeling. Next, I identified patterns like survival rates by class and age. Then, I abstracted key features (class, age, sex) while ignoring less relevant ones. Finally, I designed algorithms for imputing missing values and encoding categorical data to prepare the dataset for analysis.

**ACT2: Data Cleaning and Analysis using Titanic dataset**
I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values (median age imputation, dropping irrelevant columns) and engineered new features like family size. I performed two analyses: survival rates by passenger class (showing higher-class passengers had better survival odds) and age distribution (revealing children had higher survival rates).

**ACT3:  Introduction to SymPy**
I used SymPy to perform symbolic calculations:

    Basic Operations: Solved expressions like 53 + 10√2 and √50 × √59.

    Symbolic Equations: Created equations (2x + 3y = 12, x − y = 4) using symbols().

    Simplification: Simplified rational expressions (e.g., (x² + 2x + 1)/(x + 1) to x + 1).

    Expansion: Expanded polynomials like (2x + 2)² and (2x + y)(x − 2y) using expand().
    
**ACT4: SymPy Calculus**
I implemented calculus operations with SymPy

    Symbols: Tested basics (x + x = 2x, x * x = x²).

    Limits: Evaluated lim(sin(x)/x, x→0) and confirmed the result is 1.

    Derivatives: Computed derivatives (e.g., d/dx(x²) = 2x).

    Series Expansion: Generated Taylor series for exp(x) up to x³.

    Equation Solving: Found roots of x² − 4 = 0 (solutions: x = ±2).
